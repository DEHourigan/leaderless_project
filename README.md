## Discovery and synthesis of leaderless bacteriocins from the Actinomycetota
This repo describes the genome mining of aureocin A53-like leaderless bacteriocins and shows that they are present in the actinomycetota. 
HMMER was first used to search nr database and MGNIFY. ncbi-genome-download was used to download assemblies from Genbank. MGNIFY genomes were manually downloaed. Genome annotations were standardised using Bakta with database v5.
1. hmm_bakta.smk finds the leaderless bacteriocin core peptides in genomes found by rodeo.
2. core_peptide_analysis.r is the meat of the analysis and is used to make all plots.
